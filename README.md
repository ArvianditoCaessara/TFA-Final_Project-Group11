The repository for the Final Project of Tools For Analytics class, Columbia University. 

Project Description: 

In essence, this project provides greater insight on New York Yellow cab and Uber data, and explores their possible relationships with local weather data. By delivering a single Jupyter notebook with a crafted list of SQL queries, the project answers particular questions that aid to develop a greater understanding of the datasets and relationships. This was achieved by cleaning and filtering for relevant data, storing the data in a SQLite database, and finally providing visualizations to facilitate understanding.

The project utilizes three main data sets:  Hired-ride trip data from Uber, Hired-ride trip date from NYC Yellow cab, and local historical weather data. The timeframe of the three data sets are from January 2009 to June 2015.
